# Lorti UI Classic.

Darkens the default UI.

Big thanks to the original creator of this UI, Lorti. This is simply updated to work with the Classic client and does not work with any other vanilla/private server client.

>**IMPORTANT INFO REGARDING THE FUTURE OF THIS ADDON**
I am no longer playing Classic and will not answer any questions or try fixing any issues. If you are interested in taking over this project, send me a message on Discord.
